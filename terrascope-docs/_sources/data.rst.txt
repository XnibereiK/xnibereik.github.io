Data
=====

The current model works with .png files with resolution of up to 1024x1024. Small images are black center padded, support for large images is coming soon with image splitting.

Currently the data in use comes from the datasets available on the internet and consists of a few popular datasets for benchmarking as well as some of Terrascope's proprietary dataset labeled in-house.

Popular datasets in use:
- LoveDA
- Potsdam
- Vaihingen

.. note::
    Each of the datasets has its own ontology, which can be viewed in the labels.json file included in each of the datasets.
    The ontology can be reduced in order to get the model to focus on particular categories and make datasets compatible with each other 
    and let the model learn on the intersection of the ontologies.

Dataset canon

This section describes the format the data has to be in to be available for our pipeline for processing.

Dataset directory structure:

- labels.json
- annotations.csv
- images folder

folders
~~~~~~~

masks and images need to have the same name and be in separate folders, namely **'images'** and **'masks'**
in case masks come in RGB format, there is a function to convert to labels based on labels.json file
